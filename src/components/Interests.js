            <p>I enjoy staying active. This can include playing tennis, going to the gym or any other activity that piques my interest. In my free time I try to find a good balance between learning new skills or reading books, or simply relaxing and resting myself. A recent new interest has also been both in data science and keeping up with the latest security practises.</p>
